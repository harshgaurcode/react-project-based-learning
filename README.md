# React Project-Based Learning Journey 🚀

This repository documents my journey of mastering React by building real-world projects. Each phase targets specific concepts and includes hands-on applications to reinforce learning.

## 📌 Why This Approach?

Tired of tutorial hell, I decided to master React by **building, not just watching**. This roadmap is divided into phases, each with a focus area and projects.

## 📚 Roadmap Phases

- **Phase 1**: React Fundamentals - [✔️ Done]
- **Phase 2**: Component Architecture & Hooks - [✔️ Done]
- **Phase 3**: Routing & Navigation - [🕒 Upcoming]
- _(... more phases in progress)_
